# Medbase
### Your medical records ANYTIME, ANYWHERE!

Availability of authentic medical records at the right time is a major issue that neither our current medical system nor the existing technologies provide. This factor can and has cost many lives. This is our solution to address this problem.

### Our Soultion
MedBase is an online platform to maintain medical records of a patient. It runs on the IPFS - InterPlanetary File System protocol making it accessible even from a different planet! It's website form allows all users to use our services.

## Future Features

- Implementing Aadhar authentication to ensure each user has only one unique ID alloted.
- Incorporating Machine Learning and Image Processing to ensure that documents cannot be forged.
- Creating public awareness and finally collaborating with the government to launch the product globally.

## Our Website is Deployed in:
#### https://medbase-ii.firebaseapp.com


## Tech

MedBase uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- ReactJS
- FireBase
- LightHouse
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)

And of course MedBase itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] https://github.com/im-still-thinking/medbase-mark2.0
 on GitHub.

# Installation
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
